/* Base class for threaded tasks with support for results, progress, and cancellation.
 * This is built on top of QThreadPool/QRunnable, and makes use of the ThreadTaskCourier
 * to safely relay results.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement the runTask() method for the body of their task execution.
 * Always check isCancelled() at the beginning of the task and any other appropriate
 * points, and return immediately if true.
 *
 * The ThreadTask instance is passed to the caller as the result (via a meta-method
 * invocation of the callback function), who is expected to know how to cast the object
 * and retrieve the result from the subclass. The caller may be destroyed at any time,
 * and this object will be freed by the courier. */
